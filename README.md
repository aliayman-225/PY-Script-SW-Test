# Data Management and Reporting Script

This Python script manages a simple SQLite database, inserts sample data, exports the data to CSV and JSON formats, and generates a report based on the exported data. The script is designed to be easily runnable on any environment, with no external dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

## Features

- **Database Creation**: Creates a SQLite database with a table for storing sample data.
- **Data Insertion**: Inserts sample records into the database.
- **Data Export**: Exports the data to CSV and JSON files.
- **Report Generation**: Reads the exported files and generates a report that includes:
  - Total number of records.
  - Sample records from the CSV file.
  - Title frequency statistics from the JSON file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aliayman-225/PY-Script-SW-Test
   cd <your-path>/PY-Script-SW-Test


## Install Dependencies

The script only uses standard Python libraries, so no additional dependencies are required.

## Usage

To execute the script, use the following command:
```bash
python task_script.py
```

The script will perform the following tasks:
- Create a SQLite database (sample.db).
- Insert sample data into the database.
- Export the data to data.csv and data.json.
- Generate a report based on the exported data and display it in the console.

## Output Files
After running the script, you will find the following files in the directory:
- sample.db: The SQLite database file.
- data.csv: The CSV file containing the exported data.
- data.json: The JSON file containing the exported data.
- report.txt: Text file containing the report generated by the script

## Report Example
Also the report generated by the script will be printed to the console and includes:
- The total number of records in the database.
- Random Sample records from the CSV file.
- Title frequency statistics from the JSON file.
- Unique names statistics from the JSON file.
- Unique emails statistics from the JSON file.
- Unique zip codes statistics from the JSON file.
- Most common zip code statistics from the JSON file.
- Number of records that contains missing data.
- Email Type statistics from the JSON file.

## Running the Tests

To run the unit tests, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test_script.py
```

This command will run all the test cases defined in test_script.py, including:
- Database creation verification
- Inserting sample data into the database
- Exporting data to CSV and JSON files
- Generating a report based on the exported data
- Output from each test, including any messages and the status of test cases, will be displayed in the console.
